# ThermalHydraulics
File was generated quickly during the thermalhydraulics class to perform the calculations listed at the end of the pdf in this directory.

It stores the corresponding values (various dimensionless numbers for each fluid) and the information about different reactors, (the type of coolant used for different types of reactors, and the typical heat output rate). This allows for quick calculation of the required quantities (other dimensionless number such as Reynolds number and the heat transfer rate) when only the reactor type and the heat flow rate is inputted.
